# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
User plays with the computer by giving inputs as 0,1,2.Made using C language
## Description
The intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, is completely playable through my C Programming code. I used a random function for the computer move, which randomly selects an input to play against the user. The code is written in such a way that a user can play with the computer.

>_ In this program the user can give the following inputs:_
- 0 for rock
- 1 for paper
- 2 for scissors
- 9 for exit

### Requirements:_
- A software (IDE) for reviewing the code
- C/C++ compiler (Recommended: Dev C++ Compiler)
- Command Prompt or Windows Powershell
